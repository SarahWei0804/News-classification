# News-classification
The objective is to crawl the news on ETtoday and predict the category of the news. First, I use BeautifulSoup to scrape the content of the news from 3 categories. Then, do natural language preprocessing converting the text to numbers. Lastly, predict the category of the news by LSTM. The accuracy reaches 99%.
